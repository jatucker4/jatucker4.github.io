									<h3>In the future I would like to investigate the real-time generation of 3D dynamic scene graphs.</h3>
										<p>Currently, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms are the most common way of giving a robot an understanding of the scene that it is in. 
											An extension of the traditional SLAM algorithm is 3D dynamic scene graphs (DSGs). In 3D DSGs nodes represent spatial concepts and the edges represent 
											relations between these spatial concepts. For example, if a chair is adjacent to a wall in a house, then the chair and wall would be nodes with the adjacency 
											being the edge. DSGs also take advantage of layering to create levels of abstractions. Continuing with the house example, the house might be the top layer with 
											rooms as the layer underneath. Within this “rooms” layer, the nodes would be the rooms themselves, and the edges would describe how they are connected. This 
											results in the ability to abstract the scene based on the layer of interest. Another important result of 3D DSGs is that they provide the robot with an 
											understanding of semantic labels (e.g. chair) for spatial concepts. As humans, we use this semantic understanding of the world for more efficient processing.
											For example, if I would like to locate a set of keys, I would use the fact that the keys node is on top of the table node to streamline my search. Providing 
											robots with this semantic understanding is imperative to human-level robot perception. 3D DSGs are among the most promising ways to provide robust human-level 
											perception to a robot although there is a key open problem in the research. These graphs currently cannot be generated incrementally or in real-time. </p>

									<h3>Past Work</h3>
									<h3>GPS/GNSS Interference Power Difference of Arrival (PDOA) Localization Weighted via Nearest Neighbors</h3>
										<p>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is listed by the US Department of Homeland Security as critical infrastructure. These are essential 
											assets that underpin much of modern society and that, if removed, would have a debilitating impact on our physical health or economic system. 
											This is no exaggeration as GPS timing synchronization is used to coordinate stock exchanges, and as the navigation capabilities it provides are 
											used daily by nearly every smartphone user. Despite GPS being listed as critical infrastructure, it is very easy to interfere with it. Radio 
											frequency interference (RFI) in the form of jamming or spoofing is so incredibly accessible that emitters, made to work with car adapters, capable 
											of incapacitating vehicle tracking exist despite them being illegal. There are several methods for locating RFI emitters, and power difference of 
											arrival (PDOA) is one of the simplest and more raw ways of achieving localization. PDOA is generally used because it requires less data to provide a 
											solution than other alternatives, can be effective against both jamming and spoofing, and works against a variety of RFI signals, such as broadband noise 
											or continuous wave. This paper improves on the PDOA approach by incorporating the saturation of the receivers and the nearest neighboring receivers to 
											adjust the non-linear least squares PDOA solution. Receivers are said to be saturated when their automatic gain control has reached their power floor. 
											This means that if a receiver is saturated it cannot provide an accurate PDOA estimate because there is an infinite amount of locations within a region 
											close to the receiver that the emitter could be located. However, when the nearest neighbors to the saturated receiver are taken into account the saturation 
											helps weight the estimated location. The algorithm presented in this paper is tested using data from a government sanctioned event as part of an educational 
											agreement between CU Boulder and Edwards Air Force Base. The algorithm is tested under both broadband noise and continuous wave RFI signals and proves it can 
											improve PDOA estimation of the emitter location by a factor of 1.5.</p>

<!-- 									<h3>Equation of State Dependence of Core-Collapse Supernova Observables</h3>
										<p>The outcomes of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations can depend sensitively on the 
												nuclear phsyics of dense matter through the equation of state (EOS). In the simulation of core-collapse supernovae, 
												the EOS of nuclear matter is included through phenomological models and encoded in an EOS table for 
												use in our simulations as a relationship between the thermodyanmical variables. Due to 
												limitations in our understadning and in computational feasibility, there are many different
												models for the nuclear force resulting in many different tables that we may include in our simulations.
												Therefore, a quantitative understanding of how different EOS tables affect the
												outcome of core collapse is crucial to our ability to make predictions.
												1D CCSN simulations are ideal tools for understanding this sensitivity, as we
												can run thousands of 1D simulations to truly explore the parameter space in a
												meaningful way. Using a new model for creating physical explosions in 1D,
												I explored the sensitivity of
												CCSNe to variations in input nuclear physics by performing a population study using 
												nine open source EOS tables and 138 progenitor stars with ZAMS masses ranging from 9 to 
												120 solar masses.
												I tested the sensitivities of the observable signals to the nuclear
												equation of state and explored correlations of the signals with fundamental
												nuclear physics quantities, such as the symmetry energy and effective nucleon mass.</p>
												
												<p>I will be continuing this work with a different set of EOS tables reflecting 
												a wide range of key parameters with a larger set of progenitor stars, so stay tuned 
												for updates!</p>

									<h3>Supernova Hydrodynamics</h3>

										<p>It is by now well understood that hydrodynamics plays a crucial role in
												CCSNe. Turbulence, convection, and other hydrodynamic instabilities all
												play pivotal roles in driving the explosion. It is important, then, that
												the governing hydrodynamic equations are solved accurately and efficiently.
												I am assisting in the development of a new hydrodynamics code -- the toolkit for high-order
												neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics (<a href="https://github.com/endeve/thornado"><em>thornado</em></a>) -- 
												for CCSN simulations and related problems utilizing a spatial
												discretization based on the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method. My interests are in 
												adapting the implementation in <em>thornado</em> to work with a tabulated nuclear
												matter equation of state (EoS). Moreover, I have implemented characteristic slope
												limiting (with a tabulated EoS), as this has been shown to be more effective than limiting on the
												conserved variables.</p>
												
												<p>An initial <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1225/1/012014">methods paper</a> 
												has been published, and more work on the nuclear EoS is in progress, so stay tuned!</p>

									<h3>Prospects for High Energy Follow-up Studies of Gravitational Wave Transients</h3>
										<p>Many of the most violent and energetic events
												in the cosmos, in particular the merger of compact objects and core collapse
												supernovae, are sources of gravitational waves and are also believed to be
												connected with Gamma Ray Bursts. Joint observations of electromagnetic and
												gravitational wave signals will provide an ideal opportunity to study the
												physics of these transient events and their progenitors. In particular,
												gamma ray observatories such as Fermi, coupled with precise sky localization,
												will be crucial to observe the high energy electromagnetic counterparts to
												gravitational wave signals. We constructed joint binary neutron star and
												gamma ray burst detection rate estimates using an analysis pipeline and
												report on the results of this analysis. Moreover, I extended the analysis to 
												include a catalog of real galaxies appropriate for such a follow-up study 
												(the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05709">GLADE Catalog</a>).</p>

									<h3>Other Research</h3>
										<p><b>The nature of supernova shock revival:</b> After the onset of core collapse, the shock 
										that is responsible for tearing the star apart and driving the explosion runs out of energy and 
										stalls. The exact nature of how the shock is revived is still a matter of active research. I developed 
										data analysis tools to investigate the relative contributions of neutrino driven convection and 
										the standing accretion shock instability to shock revival. </p>

									<p><b>Construction of a Vacuum Suitcase: </b> For one summer, I worked in an experimental 
										condensed matter lab. In addition to helping run a few experiments and calibrate a 
										new instrument, I built a portable vacuum chamber for safely moving samples between instruments.</p> -->
